                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Anurag Mahapatra, a first-year Bachelor of Technology student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at VSSUT, Burla. Passionate about software development and technology, I'm eager to expand my skills and make meaningful contributions to the tech industry. With proficiency in Java, C, C++, and Python, along with a solid grasp of Object-Oriented Programming principles, I'm ready to tackle diverse challenges. Experienced in version control using Git and GitHub, I navigate Linux systems with ease and possess a strong foundation in computer systems architecture. Additionally, I have some experience in front-end development, as showcased by this website. Currently, I'm immersing myself in Data Structures and Algorithms to hone my problem-solving skills. I'm particularly excited about exploring backend development with Java and Spring Boot, and delving deeper into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Committed to clean coding practices and proficient in refactoring techniques, I prioritize building maintainable and scalable codebases. Always eager to learn and grow, I actively seek opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to the tech community.</p>

                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>As an aspiring software developer, I'm deeply passionate about technology and its possibilities. Beyond programming, I do have an interest in chess. In addition, I consume comedy sketches by creators like Ashish Chanchalani and Harsh Beniwal, as well as roast videos from CarryMinati. I find joy in playing PC games and also enjoy gameplay videos and live streams. Additionally, I appreciate stand-up comedy from artists like Anubhav Singh Bassi and Abhishek Upamanyu. I also enjoy videos on science and math by channels like Veritasium and 3Blue1Brown, as well as cooking videos by Ranveer Brar and YFL. I am a regular viewer of memes reaction by Tanmay Bhat and team. In terms of music, for a month or so I have been exploring old Bollywood songs by legends like Rafi Sahab, Jagjit Ji, and Kishore Da. While I appreciate some new Bollywood movies like 12th fail, my interest has shifted towards Hollywood and foreign films and shows, particularly in genres like fiction, adventure, thriller, and sci-fi. I had a phase where I had drowned myself in anime and manga, with "One Piece" holding a special place in my heart. Though I may not be actively watching anime or reading manga now, I still keep up with "One Piece" weekly. I also have a keen interest in the superhero genre, particularly in series like "The Boys," "Gen V," and "Invincible," which blend elements of dark comedy, drama, and mature themes with a different take on traditional superhero tropes. I also liked Marvel movies up to "Avengers: Endgame" that is and appreciate DC stories and believe it has potential but only bad execution so far except "Suicide Squad" and "Peacemaker".</p>
